# microservices
This contains how to develop microservices in Java using spring boot and automatic service discovery(with load balancing) using spring cloud(which internally uses Eureka technology provided by Netflix)

This app contains three services
1. movie-info-service(deployed on 8081 port)
2. ratings-data-service(deployed on 8082 port)
3. movie-catalog-service(deployed on 8083 port)
4. discover-server(deployed on 8085 port)

Movie-catalog-service calls other two services to get hard coded data of movies with ratings given by user and retuns a list of movies with ratings provided by user

To test you need to call:
http://localhost:8083/catalog/1

**Basic microservices with service discovery enabled**
